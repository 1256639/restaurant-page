# Restaurant Page

[**Live Demo**](https://1256639.github.io/restaurant-page/)

---

A single-page restaurant website built with **JavaScript**, **Webpack**, and **DOM manipulation**.  
All content is generated dynamically via JavaScript modules, no static HTML beyond the template!

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Tabs:** Switch between Home, Menu, and About sections without reloading the page.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Each page (Home, Menu, About) is a separate ES6 module for clarity and maintainability.
- **Webpack Bundled:** All assets processed and bundled with Webpack.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** No frameworks; all DOM manipulation and event handling is done natively.

---
